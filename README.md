# Tunnel Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Maven Fuzzy Factory Dataset

This project aims to analyze the relationship between advertising strategies and organic traffic using the **Maven Fuzzy Factory** dataset. Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Funnel Analysis** conducted in SQL, the effectiveness of digital marketing strategies has been evaluated.

## 📌 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the impact of advertising and organic traffic on sales and identify which traffic sources yield higher conversion rates. Within this scope, two main analyses were performed using the **Maven Fuzzy Factory** dataset:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the structure of the dataset, extracting basic statistics, and assessing data quality.
2. **Funnel Analysis**: Examining user behavior on the website to determine conversion rates and identify bottlenecks.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Primary tool for data querying, analysis, and reporting.
- **Maven Fuzzy Factory Dataset**: The main data source used for analysis.
- **Git**: Used for version control of project files.

## 📂 Project Files

The project includes two main SQL files:

1. **EDA.sql**: SQL queries for exploratory data analysis.
   - Structure and basic statistics of the dataset.
   - Examination of missing data and outliers.
   - Analysis of user behavior by traffic sources.

2. **Funnel_Analysis.sql**: SQL queries for funnel analysis.
   - Step-by-step examination of user behavior on the website.
   - Calculation of conversion rates.
   - Identification of bottlenecks and improvement suggestions.

## 📊 Analysis Process

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Basic concepts such as **session_id**, **pageview_id**, and **utm_source** were examined.
- Data was categorized into organic and advertising sources.
- Analysis of which devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) generated the most traffic.

### 2️⃣ Funnel Analysis
- User behavior on the website was examined step by step.
- **Page Activation → Order** conversion rates were calculated.
- Identification of which ad types (b_ad, g_ad, social) yielded higher conversions.

---

## 💡 Key Findings

- **Organic Traffic** generates higher engagement and sales rates compared to paid advertising.
- Most successful device: **Desktop computers**.
- **Social media ads** underperformed, while **b_ad** and **g_ad** ads were more effective.
- The highest **"page activation → order"** conversion rate was achieved through **b_ad** ads.

---

## 🚧 Challenges and Solutions

- **Technical Terms**: Understanding concepts like **pageview_id** and **session_id** took time. This challenge was overcome by researching resources and writing sample queries.
- **Data Categorization**: By learning about **UTM Source**, data was correctly categorized.
